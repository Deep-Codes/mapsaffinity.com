# Maps Affinity

![mapsaffinity.com](/public/mapsaffinity.png)

When I was 17 back in 2019 I created an Instagram page called @maps_affinity during my summer break. I used to curate and post content around choropleth visualizations.

It peaked a total of over 19,000+ followers, with notable followers like [Jhonny Harris](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGSJVG3mCRXVOP4yZrU1Dw), [India in Pixels](https://www.youtube.com/@iip).

mapsaffinity.com was built to preserve all my posts.

## How this was built?

I requested all the data from instagram which was around 2.7GB, parsed out all 330 posts with some meta data.

Gallery was built using Vercel's [Image Gallery Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/image-gallery-starter) can't thank the team enough.

## Future

if time permits, mostly will prioritise these features.

- Also show meta data in posts (title, likes etc)
- Maybe start posting visualisation on the page again :)
- Search
